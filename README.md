# Election Poll

To run, create a database and user, and update the credentials in config.php.

To create the database, you should then access the web page with ?init=true

This will create the two tables, one for constituencies and one for responses. The constituencies are
populated from government data. You may have issues with run time - it was close to the 30 second limit
on my PC, but if you are running it on a faster server you shouldnt have any trouble.
